* Koeeoadi

  Koeeoadi is a web app for building color themes for Emacs and Vim
  (GUI only).  [[http://thescratchcastle.com/koeeoadi][Click here to check it out.]]

#+NAME:   fig:koeeoadi-preview

  It's somewhat different from other online theme creators because you
  can click directly on code to edit its styling.  It also supports
  definition of custom faces.  This means you can define styles for
  any Emacs face or Vim highlighting group.  In addition to theme
  export, you can also save your theme to a .koee file for editing
  later.

  I built Koeeoadi in order to learn more about Om Next, a very
  awesome Clojurescript framework for building web applications.  I
  highly recommend checking it out if you haven't already.

  If you're working on an Om Next app and using this repo as a reference,
  then please keep in mind that I'm still figuring out the best way to
  do things in Om so please don't assume everything here is exemplary.

* Face Mapping

Koeeoadi expects you to style the default faces.  These faces cover
basic programming language syntax.  The table below shows how
Koeeoadi's faces map to the built-in faces and highlighting groups of
Emacs and VIM, respectively.

| Koeeoadi Default Faces | Emacs Face                       | Vim Syntax Group                                   |
|------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|

| default                | default                          | Normal                                             |
| builtin                | font-lock-builtin-face           | -                                                  |
| comment-delimiter      | font-lock-comment-delimiter-face | Comment                                            |
| comment                | font-lock-comment-face           | Comment                                            |
| constant               | font-lock-constant-face          | Constant                                           |
| doc                    | font-lock-doc-face               | Comment                                            |
| function-name          | font-lock-function-name-face     | Function                                           |
| keyword                | font-lock-keyword-face           | Exception - Label - Repeat - Conditional - Keyword |
| preprocessor           | font-lock-preprocessor-face      | PreProc - Include - Define - Macro - PreCondit     |
| string                 | font-lock-string-face            | String                                             |
| type                   | font-lock-type-face              | Type                                               |
| variable-name          | font-lock-variable-name-face     | Identifier                                         |

There are two themes included with Koeeoadi that contain the most
common VIM and Emacs faces.  These are called 'vim-theme-all-faces'
and 'emacs-theme-all-faces'.  You may want to use those out if you're
looking to build an extensive theme.
