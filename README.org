* Koeeoadi

  Koeeoadi is a web app for building color themes for Emacs and Vim
  (GUI only).  *Click Here* to check it out.

  It's somewhat different from other online theme creators because you
  can click directly on code to edit its styling.  It also supports
  definition of custom faces.  This means you can define styles for
  any Emacs face or Vim highlighting group.  In addiiton, to theme
  export, you can also save your theme to a `.koee` file so that you
  can open it later for further editing.

  I built Koeeoadi as an exercise for learning about Om Next, a very
  awesome Clojurescript framework for buildings applications.  I
  highly recommend checking it out if you haven't already.

  If you're also working on an Om Next app and using this as a
  reference, then please keep in mind that I'm still figuring out the
  best way to do things in Om so please don't consider this a shining
  example.

* Face Mapping

Koeeoadi expects you to style the default faces.  These faces cover
basic programming language syntax.  The table below shows how
Koeeoadi's faces map to the built-in faces and highlighting groups of
Emacs and VIM, respectively.
